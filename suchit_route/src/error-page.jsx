import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";

export default function ErrorPage () {
    const error = useRouteError ();
    // define variable name
    console.error(error);

    return (
        <div id="error-page">
            <h1>Oops! you F*ucked up</h1>
            <p>Sorry, An unexpected error has occurred.</p>
            <p><i>{error.statusText || error.message}</i></p>
        </div>
    );
}

// Note that useRouteError provides the error that was thrown. When the user navigates to routes that don't exist you'll get an error response with a "Not Found" statusText. We'll see some other errors later in the tutorial and discuss them more.

// For now, it's enough to know that pretty much all of your errors will now be handled by this page instead of infinite spinners, unresponsive pages, or blank screens ðŸ™Œ
